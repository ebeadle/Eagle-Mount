# Slope Scheduler: 
:date:
The Slope Scheduler has been designed with Eagle Mountâ€™s adaptive ski-program in mind.  Their organization matches volunteers with participants for a ski date.  During those times when a designated volunteer needs a substitute, this app will provide a user friendly interface for Eagle Mount to display the time and needs for the desired shift.
